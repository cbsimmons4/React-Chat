Chat Room web app built using Node.js, React.js, and Socket.io. All users have a unique username, the ability to send messages in the community chat, and can logout. (Built while following a Tutorial by Loan Watson: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYjktLnPZi4LHSz1QXwc4dA )

Test functionality:
1. enter username
2. Send messages in global chat
3. Logout by clicking on the eject icon in the bottom left on the side bar.
4. Try opening multiple web browsers to have multiple users chatting in the community chat.
5. Try having the same user login in a second time while alreay logged in (It shouldn't work).


Note: Only the chat and logout feature work. All other UI "button" and icons are for show, just to give a chat app feel.
